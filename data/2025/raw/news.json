We hope you\u2019ll find Glastonbury Festival to be an inclusive microcosm of that ideal; one that celebrates individuality and difference, amplifies those with quieter voices and delights, entertains and inspires all, so that everyone who is welcomed here, leaves energised and enlightened. Because <i>this</i> kind of mutual respect \u2013 for our environment as well as for each other \u2013 is what it will take to be truly sustainable.</p><p>Below are a few things we\u2019re proud to have achieved on our journey so far. For more information, please read our <a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/info/#sustainability--impact-summary\">Impact Summary</a>.</p><ul><li><p><b>No fossil fuels are used for power anywhere on the Glastonbury Festival site. </b>All generators run entirely on responsibly sourced virgin palm oil-free HVO fuel made from waste cooking oil, helping to reduce direct CO2e emissions by up to 90%.</p></li><li><p>In a determined drive to reduce non recyclable waste and promote more sustainable alternatives, <b>the sale of single-use plastic drink bottles is banned on-site </b>and all crisps are sold in <b>compostable packaging</b>.</p></li><li><p>Our <b>sustainable travel initiatives </b>have helped over hundreds of thousands of ticket holders travel to the Festival by bike or public transport. Each year, more than 65,000 ticket holders take advantage of these for their Festival travel.</p></li><li><p>Our own <b>on-site recycling plant </b>is the country\u2019s largest events-run facility and ensures we can hand-separate our own waste for single stream recycling, avoiding the need to send waste to landfill.</p></li><li><p><b>All crockery and plates at the Festival are either reusable or compostable </b>\u2013 and inedible food waste is turned into fertile compost or sent to anaerobic digestion.</p></li><li><p>All production areas are either <b>powered by lower impact, fossil fuel-free electricity or run on solar PV and battery hybrid systems.</b></p></li><li><p>We <b>engage as many people as we can </b>with issues which we feel passionately about such as climate change activism, sustainable living, diversity and inclusivity, and have created stages and areas in which to share ideas.</p></li><li><p>We passionately <b>support our charity partners </b>\u2013 Greenpeace, Oxfam and WaterAid \u2013 and other charitable causes and campaigns helping to raise awareness of humanitarian, social and environmental issues close to our heart.</p></li><li><p>We have a fleet of <b>electric and hybrid vehicles </b>to transport our crew and artists.</p></li><li><p>A <b>temporary wind turbine</b>, installed alongside a solar panel and battery system, will produce up to 300kWh of energy per day and power food stalls in Carhenge.</p></li><li><p><b>Clean energy </b>from the Festival\u2019s own 250kMp solar PV array, as well as our anaerobic digester and 125kVA biogas plant power, provide energy for Festival offices and some production areas as well as helping to charge some battery systems.</p></li><li><p>Over <b>98% of all tents </b>have been taken home after each Festival since 2019.</p></li><li><p><b>Our Green Fields have run on solar, wind and pedal power since 1984</b>, setting a fossil fuel-free standard we aspire towards implementing across the Festival.</p></li><li><p>By exclusively supporting <b>Fairtrade Certified </b>coffee, tea, sugar, drinking chocolate and cotton, both on site and in our official website store, we\u2019re helping to empower communities of growers.</p></li><li><p>Worthy Farm and the Festival site is rich with biodiversity and we have <b>protected areas across the Festival site </b>to help ensure these habitats and their wildlife are looked after.</p></li></ul><img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/upXZWbPawu5_ba52qugbbg/gcfprod-B4qqftijpzOUBfpEGdO1J/public\" alt=\"Glastonbury2025 A1 BackStage DIGITAL-1085x1536\"><p></p>"

Small actions taken by one can \u2013 when echoed by others \u2013 can have an exponential effect powerful enough to drive societal change. All it takes is just one step in the right direction.</p><p>Here are a few examples of how some small changes we can make, ahead of the Festival and while we are here, can have a powerful ripple-inducing impact if all ticket-holders join in.</p><ul><li><p>By switching off your non-essential electrical appliances before the Festival, you can help save up to 1kg of CO2e across five days. This action, when echoed by every household at the Festival, could help save enough energy to power nearly 100 UK homes for an entire year.</p></li><li><p>By refilling your reusable bottles once daily at the Festival, compared to buying single-use plastic bottles, together we can help save the CO2e equivalent of driving a diesel car 485,000 miles or around the world nearly 20 times!</p></li><li><p>Based on average car use, by not driving over 5 days while at the Festival, you can individually avoid over 32kgs of CO2e; it would take three mature trees one year to absorb this amount of carbon.</p></li><li><p>Remember your Worthy Pledge: treat each other with kindness and respect. 63% of UK adults say their mental health is improved when kindness is shown to them - and also when they are kind to others.</p></li><li><p>If you can, switch your home energy tariff to renewable sources and drive investment into green energy shifting the UK away from fossil fuels and towards a more sustainable future.</p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/info/#sustainability--power-of-one\">Click here</a> for information about our methodology.</p><p>For further inspiration please see some highlights from the many talks, workshops and events happening across the Festival which should inspire, inform and invigorate! </p><p><b>Permaculture Garden\n\u2014 Garden tours running Wednesday \u2013 Sunday at 2pm, 3pm and 4pm.</b>\nThe Festival\u2019s permaculture garden has raised over 3,000 edible plants and herbs to create a stunning show garden with lettuces to lemon balm, fennel to feverfew and nasturtium to nettle.

Rock fans face a big clash later with <b>Idles</b> (Other stage, 22.15) and <b>Fontaines DC</b> (23.00, the Park stage), though the prospect of brand new material from the latter, arguably the best lyricists working today, makes it unmissable. <b>Alvvays</b> (Woodsies, 17.00, Sun) are for my money the best band at this year\u2019s Festival: their 2022 album Blue Rev was a dream-pop masterpiece and it translates into a gloriously widescreen live sound. <b>Mannequin Pussy</b> (Woodsies, 14.00, Sat) and <b>Bar Italia</b> (the Park stage, 14.00, Saturday) are rightly buzzed about, while <b>The Vaccines</b> (Woodsies, 16.30, Fri) may no longer be, though they have underrated recent material in spades. For singer-songwriter fans, <b>Kara Jackson</b> (the Park stage, 12.45, Sat) and <b>Willie J Healey </b>(Greenpeace, 16.4500, Sat) each have a spellbinding mix of droll humour, affecting storytelling and tangy melodies, while at the other end of the noise spectrum both <b>Skindred</b> (Avalon, 23.05, Fri) and <b>Bob Vylan</b> (Left Field, 21.00, Sun; Peace stage, 01.30, Sun/Mon) craft moshpits full of righteous positive energy. Masked alt-pop star <b>Lynks</b> (Greenpeace, 21.35, Thu; the Park stage, 11.30, Fri) is exactly what you want at a festival \u2013 funny, high energy, with dance moves that are easy to copy even after seven pints, and for something truly befitting the \u201calternative\u201d tag, try the theatrical strangeness of far-outlier <b>Klein</b> (19.40, Thursday), and the marrow-jolting ambience of Kenya\u2019s <b>KMRU</b> (00.00, Friday, both Tree stage). </p>"

Below is a handy guide to what to bring with you to the Festival \u2013 and what you should leave at home!</p><h2><b>When thinking about what to pack, please bear these things in mind:</b></h2><ul><li><p><b>Only bring what you really need. </b>However you arrive, you\u2019ll inevitably <b>have to carry your stuff </b>a fair distance to where you camp. And as part of our Love Worthy Farm, Leave No Trace campaign we\u2019d definitely encourage you to <b>only bring things which you can take home </b>\u2013 that includes everything, even your tent.</p></li><li><p><b>Please use luggage tags. </b>Please label all of your bags and belongings stating your name and mobile number, so that we can identify them as yours.</p></li><li><p><b>Please be patient. </b>For security reasons, ticket holders will be subject to searches of their vehicles, their bags and their person at this year\u2019s Festival. Please cooperate with any security requests and all searches.</p></li><li><p><b>The less you bring, the quicker you\u2019ll get through the gates. </b>As a general rule, we would ask you to only bring as much as you can carry yourself. We do appreciate that you\u2019re going to be staying on the farm for several days, but travelling light really will make things quicker. There will be separate search lanes for those with large luggage and trolleys, and we anticipate that these lanes will be significantly slower.</p></li><li><p><b>Please do not wrap your bags. </b>Avoid using the thick plastic wrap you sometimes see at airports. Your bags will need to be accessible for searches and you\u2019ll be bringing unnecessary waste onto the Festival site.</p></li><li><p><b>Don\u2019t skimp on the essentials. </b>Please bring a sturdy tent (and take it back home with you). Although you\u2019ll be able buy pretty much anything you need here on site, there are now fewer camping equipment stores than there have been in the past. So please bring a sturdy tent that will last a lifetime of festival camping.</p></li><li><p><b>Please be a considerate Festival-goer. </b>If you do bring camping chairs / blankets to use at busy stages, please make sure that they are kept away from designated paths; and that there is plenty of room between you and the next set of chairs / blankets, so that people can still easily walk through. Please also bear in mind that for some people, having somewhere to sit is not a luxury but essential to their ability to see the show \u2013 not all disabilities are visible. For really popular artists, we might need to ask people who are able to, to pack up their rugs / chairs so that as many people as possible can enjoy the show. We only make these announcements when it\u2019s really important, so please help us if you can.</p></li><li><p><b>REUSE, REDUCE, RESPECT. </b>In a stand to make our world more sustainable, we ask you to avoid single-use items and opt for reusable options wherever possible and help us look after the land on which the Festival stands.</p></li></ul><p><b>What to bring</b></p><ul><li><p>Festival ticket</p></li><li><p>Travel tickets if coming by coach / train</p></li><li><p>Personal ID:\nOriginal ID documents (not photocopies) are needed for: Hospitality tickets, Challenge 21, Lead Booker for coach packages, Sunday tickets\n\u2013 Photocopy of ID is okay if a child is under 12 but looks older</p></li><li><p>Money/cards</p></li><li><p>Mobile phone + battery pack. <a href=\"https://vodafone.seetickets.com/event/glastonbury-battery-pack-hire/vodafone-connect-charge/3210300\">You can also hire a Vodafone battery pack</a> \u2013 simply collect on site at the Vodafone Connect &amp; Charge and exchange daily for a freshly charged one.</p></li><li><p>Ear plugs \u2013 to keep your ears from ringing!</p></li><li><p>A reusable water bottle, to fill up from the free taps on site</p></li><li><p>Tent (lines/poles/groundsheet/pegs)</p></li><li><p>Sleeping mat/sleeping bag/duvet/pillow</p></li><li><p>Wellies or sturdy boots</p></li><li><p>Waterproof coat and over trousers</p></li><li><p>Change of weather-appropriate clothing (in case you get wet!) including cosy sweater \u2013 it can be hot in the day and chilly at night</p></li><li><p>Toiletries including towel/soap</p></li><li><p>Medication if required (<a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/info/#advice-and-facilities--medical-and-first-aid---prescribed-medicine-policy\">click here</a> for the Festival\u2019s prescribed medication policy)</p></li><li><p>Next of kin notification</p></li><li><p>Medical info (allergies etc)</p></li><li><p>Toilet roll</p></li><li><p>Sun cream + hat</p></li><li><p>Contraceptives</p></li><li><p>Spectacles/contacts and solution</p></li><li><p>Torch/batteries/bulbs (spares)</p></li><li><p>Bin bags (for dirty clothing and footwear)</p></li><li><p>Mark valuables with house name and postcode so it can be posted back to you</p></li></ul><p><b>What not to bring</b></p><ul><li><p><b>Do not bring more than you need. </b>Remember you\u2019ll need to take all it home again. Most things can be bought on site if necessary.</p></li><li><p><b>Do not bring disposable vapes. </b>They pollute the environment and can be hazardous at waste centres.</p></li><li><p><b>Don\u2019t bring gazebos. </b>They take up valuable tent space in the campsites. We\u2019d also rather you didn\u2019t put tape around your tent enclosures, please. It makes it harder for other people to get to their tents.</p></li><li><p><b>Only food and alcohol for personal consumption can be brought onsite.</b></p></li><li><p><b>Do not bring any knives.</b></p></li><li><p><b>Do not bring anything made of glass. </b>All glass will be confiscated if found, including perfume and mirrors.</p></li><li><p><b>Do not bring excess packaging. </b>If you purchase something new for the Festival, please remove all the excess packing at home, before you arrive.</p></li><li><p><b>Do not bring body glitter. </b>Even biodegradable body glitter will not properly breakdown without being heat-treated.</p></li><li><p><b>Please avoid the use of disposable wipes. </b>Wipes \u2013 even biodegradable wipes, which quickly breakdown into micro-plastics \u2013 are problematic environmental pollutants. Plant fibre-based biodegradable wipes release greenhouse gases when they decompose, so we would like people to really try to use alternatives. A washcloth and a bar of soap works wonders!</p></li><li><p><b>You may be searched </b>at the entrance for any items that may be used in an illegal or offensive manner \u2013 which will be confiscated. Persons suspected of carrying out illegal and/or offensive activities onsite may also be searched and face eviction. </p><p><b>NB: </b>Confiscated items will NOT be returned.</p></li></ul><p><b>Please DO NOT bring any of these prohibited items:</b></p><ul><li><p>No portable laser equipment or pens are permitted.</p></li><li><p>No knives.</p></li><li><p>No animals (except registered guide dogs).</p></li><li><p>No sound systems or drums.</p></li><li><p>No generators.</p></li><li><p>No sky lanterns, kites, fireworks, flares or any type or wax candles.</p></li><li><p>No nitrous oxide (laughing gas). As a contraband good, under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 this substance is banned at Glastonbury. It is very dangerous to inhale nitrous oxide directly from the canister and if you take too much nitrous oxide you risk falling unconscious and/or suffocating from the lack of oxygen.</p></li></ul><p><b>Please note:</b></p><ul><li><p>Persons using fireworks will be evicted from site and materials confiscated.</p></li><li><p>No unauthorised tape recorders, professional film or video equipment are allowed onsite. Cameras for personal use are welcome.</p></li><li><p>Flying or filming with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or so-called drones) is not allowed on site before, during or after the Festival \u2013 and is prohibited by law. We have a working site and the safety of our audience, crew and staff is paramount.</p></li></ul><img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/upXZWbPawu5_ba52qugbbg/gcfprod-6rxrkUzNbC5v4AflLkg6OB/public\" alt=\"Glastonbury 950x400px Banners REDUCE\"><p></p>"

At that point, access to the field / stage might be temporarily closed, so it\u2019s always worth having other options in mind.</p><p><b>Get there early.</b> If there is a performance that you really don\u2019t want to miss, plan to arrive well in advance (some people literally get there hours ahead of time). And definitely try to avoid arriving just before or during a popular set.</p><p><b>If we announce that a performance is expected to be busy</b>, we would recommend you avoid those ones with children under the age of 13, particularly if they\u2019re in a pushchair or cart, which can be difficult and stressful to navigate through big, bustling crowds. </p><p><b>Please use the whole venue / field when arriving at a performance and move into space rather than stopping by the entrance. </b>Please also follow the directions of our stewards and security who will be kept informed on the clearest places to send you to. </p><p><b>Use particular flags, trees or poles etc, as landmarks to meet your mates</b>, rather than the front of house sound engineer\u2019s desk \u2013 lots of people use that and it can get crowded near them.</p><p><b>Please let people come past you if you have found your position.</b> There is often lots of space available beyond your favourite spot, and others may wish to go forward.</p><p><b>Please be considerate of others.</b> If you\u2019re arranging chairs or picnic blankets to watch acts from, please position them in sensible, considerate places and avoid placing them on main walking routes. Please make sure there are clear gaps where other people can easily walk through. And please be prepared to move chairs or picnic blankets if requested by a steward \u2013 we need to keep certain areas clear for everyone\u2019s safety.</p><p><b>If you are sitting waiting for a gig, please stand up if the area starts to get busy. </b></p><p><b>At the end of a popular performance, it\u2019s always worth stopping and having a chat for 10 minutes to avoid the mass exodus</b>. At some point everyone has to pass through an exit, and this does take time.</p><p><b>Look out for our recommended alternative exit routes at the end of popular performances.</b> Often, a longer walking route away can actually be quicker than a shorter one, as it skips the big, slow-moving crowds.</p><p><b>Explore outer space. </b>Head away from the main stage arenas to discover the eclectic otherness and unexpected wonders \u2013 convivial campfires, fringe tents and bonkers bars \u2013 that truly set Glastonbury apart.</p><img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/upXZWbPawu5_ba52qugbbg/gcfprod-4lFiO1qLXAhghnnUwndhK5/public\" alt=\"Matthew Cardy - SUNDAY-28\"><p></p>"

The afternoon is topped off with one of Annie\u2019s favourite acts, The Orb, who she championed in the early \u201990s, bringing their music to the world.</p><p>The celebration then moves to the BBC Introducing Stage after darkness has fallen, for a late-night session going into the early hours. The DJs will be covering the music Annie brought to the world from the \u201890s through to the present day through her show, with Jon Carter playing a set of big beat, the sound that kicked off some of the UK\u2019s biggest dance acts\u2019 careers. Representing Breakbeat and Nu Skool breaks are two of Annie\u2019s favourite DJs, Krafty Kuts and Plump DJs, who will be playing a special back-to-back set.

                    "stringValue": "<p>Every year, thanks to the support of our Festival-goers, crew and volunteers, Glastonbury is fortunate enough to be able to make charity donations to many amazing organisations working to make life better for those in need. </p><p>In this feature, the second in our Charity Spotlight series, we shine a light on one of these inspiring charities and the dedicated people behind them.</p><p><b>Black Lives In Music</b> is a charity defiantly working to bring about equal opportunities for Black, Asian and Ethnically Diverse people in the music industry by inspiring and nurturing talent at the grass roots level and fighting to see it flourish in all areas and at all levels of the industry.</p><p>We caught up with charity founder, Charisse Beaumont, to find out more.</p><p><b>Tell us a bit about BLiM?</b> \nBlack Lives in Music (BLiM) is a charity dedicated to making sure the UK music industry is a place where everyone \u2013 especially Black and Global Majority people \u2013 can thrive; on stage, behind the scenes and at every level of leadership. Whether you\u2019re a sound engineer, violinist, rapper or record executive, our message is simple: you belong in this industry.</p><p><b>How did the charity come into being? \n</b>BLiM was founded in 2020 by Roger Wilson, a classically trained musician, and myself, a former music industry professional, after we found there was a lack of data concerning the lived experience of Black and Global Majority music creators across the music ecosystem. As a direct response, we published our first report, Being Black In The UK Music Industry, in 2021. The report data showed 63% of Black music creators have experienced racism and 88% of Black music professionals face barriers to career progression. This proved to be a powerful mirror held up to the industry, confirming what many already knew but few had the data to prove. That moment sparked a movement and from it, BLiM the charity, was formed.</p><p><b>What does BLiM aim to do? \n</b>We\u2019re here to break down the barriers that stop Black and ethnically diverse people from progressing in the music industry. We\u2019re pushing for change in education, employment, orchestras, leadership and creative spaces. It\u2019s about ensuring that from the first music lesson to the biggest festival stage, everyone has access and opportunity.</p><p><b>How are you working to bring about positive change? \n</b>We work with 110 music organisations, universities, record labels and festivals to embed inclusivity in everything they do. Our BLiM charter sets the standard. We run programmes like Turn it Up and Equaliser to train people in technical professions and give them opportunities, particularly in areas where representation is low, like sound engineering. In fact, this year, our engineers will be working at Glastonbury. We are sending our crew of Black and gender diverse women to engineer at the Festival. Now that\u2019s representation in action!</p><p><b>BLiM work particularly hard to open up opportunities in the jazz and classical music industries. What is different about these industries compared with other music genres in the UK? \n</b>Jazz and classical music are rich with history but they\u2019ve often felt closed to people of colour. These spaces are more formal, more institution-led, and, sadly, often less diverse. That\u2019s why we focus on them. We want to make sure conservatoires, orchestras and jazz venues are places where Black and Global Majority talent is celebrated. We run a program called Recruiting Classical which each year sees over 600 Global Majority players audition for the top orchestras in the UK. Another program is Classically Black, which showcases the very best in cutting-edge classical music \u2013 our next symposiums will be taking place in Birmingham (October 10th), and London (October 18th). We have over 40 orchestras signed-up to our ten-point plan on inclusive recruitment in classical music, which supports a unified approach of recruitment of musicians in orchestras in the UK classical music sector.</p><p><b>What impact have you had? \n</b>Our research has had a huge impact. Being Black In The UK Music Industry, Unseen Unheard (which looked at the lived experience of Black disabled creators and professionals), and Your Safety, Your Say \u2013 our research into bullying and harassment in the music industry \u2013 have led to national conversations and tangible change at government level. Our REMEL (Race Equality in Music Event Licensing) research has seen us give recommendations to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mayor of London and Chancellor of Exchequer. We launched an Anti Racist Code of Conduct and will launch EquiTrack, a tech tool which will help the UK Music Industry reach their diversity objectives. And our training programmes are placing young people into real jobs and roles they never imagined possible, like working on major festivals and classical stages.</p><p><b>What is the most rewarding thing about the work that you do?\n</b>It\u2019s seeing someone walk into a space they once thought wasn\u2019t for them and realise they belong. It\u2019s the emails that say, \u201cI was about to give up, but BLiM reminded me why I started.\u201d It\u2019s the young sound engineer working their first big stage. Those are the moments that keep us going.</p><p><b>How can someone benefit?\n</b>If you\u2019re working in music, we\u2019re here to support you through mentoring, training, advocacy and connection. And if you\u2019re an ally, there\u2019s room for you too. We welcome volunteers, donors and organisations that want to do better. Whatever your role, you\u2019ll find that being part of BLiM means being part of a movement that\u2019s bigger than any one of us.</p><p><b>How do organisations like Glastonbury\u2019s help BLiM? \n</b>Support from Glastonbury and others is vital. They help turn inclusion from talk into action. By offering opportunities to our engineers, they\u2019re not just diversifying their crew, they\u2019re setting a new standard for the industry. Their platform also amplifies our voice, helping us reach more people, open more doors and create more impact. It\u2019s a partnership that proves representation works, on stage, off stage and everywhere in between.</p><p><b>Where can people find out more about supporting you or getting involved?\n</b>Visit <a href=\"https://blim.org.uk/\">blim.org.uk</a> to sign up, donate, partner or just learn more. Follow us @BlackLivesInMusic on IG and TikTok and @blklivesinmusic on X to join the conversation.

On hand is the Wyvern\u2019s Watch bar, serenaded with super chilled Carnival vibes from an array of authentic Notting Hill Carnival Sound Systems. Make sure you visit in daylight too to fully appreciate the beautiful giant sculpture that lends the area its name.</p><p><b>Take in some hilltop vistas</b>\nHigh on the hill, beyond the Tipi Field you\u2019ll find the convivial camp fire of <b>Strummerville</b>.<b> </b>With its inviting fireside seats and singalongs, it\u2019s dedicated to the memory of Joe Strummer and served by the welcoming CasBar, so that neither your beer nor bonhomie can run dry. For ample personal space and a cracking view of the Festival beneath, head beyond the Ribbon Tower and <b>up above the Park</b>. Sit yourself by the iconic Glastonbury sign on the southernmost tip of the Festival site and watch the sun set, the moon rise or simply the whole of the Festival, as it quietly unfurls beneath you.</p><p><b>Visit the Green Fields\n</b>Once the main stages kick in, these fields offer a quieter, market-like experience, where noise is low-level and people traffic is less congested. Head into the blissful calm of the <b>Permaculture Garden</b> to see how we can live in true harmony with nature, while piously enjoying a slice of organic cake. From here, head through the inspirational <b>Green Futures</b>, dipping in on a few environmentally-themed talks, to the <b>Healing Fields</b> and <b>Peace Garden</b>, one of the Festival\u2019s most chilled out areas. At the <b>King&#39;s Meadow</b>, eschew the Stone Circle, and instead hunt for the majestic dragon, bathing in the cool spring nearby.</p><p><b>Explore the Wood\n</b>Nestled on the north side of the Festival, leading to Woodsies and the chilled-out canopied-delight of the ambient <b>Tree Stage</b>, <b>The Wood</b> is a nature-rich sanctuary to bask in tree-dappled sunlight. Climb up to the ship-shaped platform high up in the big ash tree (a nod to Michael Eavis\u2019s early seafaring adventures), and stroll along the bridge through the tree canopy, peering through branches at the looming Glastonbury Tor in the distance. At night, illuminations light up the foliage making it all seem that much more magical.</p><p><b>Daylight hours in the South East Corner &amp; Silver Hayes\n</b>At night, the Festival\u2019s South East corner \u2013 comprising Block9, Unfairground, The Common and Shangri-La \u2013 and the enthralling neon-lit stages of Silver Hayes, are busy beacons to partying Festival-goers. But during daylight hours the spaces become gloriously laid-back and unveil their campaign-lead identities. Take the time to wander around these impressive builds and fully soak-in their inspired creativity.</p><p><b>Theatre &amp; Circus\n</b>Marvel at the wonderful Walkabouts and astounding street performers that make this pocket of the Festival one of the best places to escape the crowds. </p><p><b>Festival Welfare \n</b>If you do become overwhelmed or feel you need someone to talk to, head to <b>Worthy Welfare </b>near the Big Ground medical centre, <b>Green Welfare</b> in the Green Fields or the <b>Worthy Rest </b>hubs<b> </b>at the Park and in Silver Hayes where specialised counselling teams from Safer Spaces Now and iThink are on hand for support and advice.</p>"

                    "stringValue": "<p>Every year, thanks to the support of our Festival-goers, crew and volunteers, Glastonbury is fortunate enough to be able to make charity donations to many amazing organisations working to make life better for those in need. </p><p>In this feature, the second in our Charity Spotlight series, we shine a light on one of these inspiring charities and the dedicated people behind them.</p><p><b>Black Lives In Music</b> is a charity defiantly working to bring about equal opportunities for Black, Asian and Ethnically Diverse people in the music industry by inspiring and nurturing talent at the grass roots level and fighting to see it flourish in all areas and at all levels of the industry.</p><p>We caught up with charity founder, Charisse Beaumont, to find out more.</p><p><b>Tell us a bit about BLiM?</b> \nBlack Lives in Music (BLiM) is a charity dedicated to making sure the UK music industry is a place where everyone \u2013 especially Black and Global Majority people \u2013 can thrive; on stage, behind the scenes and at every level of leadership. Whether you\u2019re a sound engineer, violinist, rapper or record executive, our message is simple: you belong in this industry.</p><p><b>How did the charity come into being? \n</b>BLiM was founded in 2020 by Roger Wilson, a classically trained musician, and myself, a former music industry professional, after we found there was a lack of data concerning the lived experience of Black and Global Majority music creators across the music ecosystem. As a direct response, we published our first report, Being Black In The UK Music Industry, in 2021. The report data showed 63% of Black music creators have experienced racism and 88% of Black music professionals face barriers to career progression. This proved to be a powerful mirror held up to the industry, confirming what many already knew but few had the data to prove. That moment sparked a movement and from it, BLiM the charity, was formed.</p><p><b>What does BLiM aim to do? \n</b>We\u2019re here to break down the barriers that stop Black and ethnically diverse people from progressing in the music industry. We\u2019re pushing for change in education, employment, orchestras, leadership and creative spaces. It\u2019s about ensuring that from the first music lesson to the biggest festival stage, everyone has access and opportunity.</p><p><b>How are you working to bring about positive change? \n</b>We work with 110 music organisations, universities, record labels and festivals to embed inclusivity in everything they do. Our BLiM charter sets the standard. We run programmes like Turn it Up and Equaliser to train people in technical professions and give them opportunities, particularly in areas where representation is low, like sound engineering. In fact, this year, our engineers will be working at Glastonbury. We are sending our crew of Black and gender diverse women to engineer at the Festival. Now that\u2019s representation in action!</p><p><b>BLiM work particularly hard to open up opportunities in the jazz and classical music industries. What is different about these industries compared with other music genres in the UK? \n</b>Jazz and classical music are rich with history but they\u2019ve often felt closed to people of colour. These spaces are more formal, more institution-led, and, sadly, often less diverse. That\u2019s why we focus on them. We want to make sure conservatoires, orchestras and jazz venues are places where Black and Global Majority talent is celebrated. We run a program called Recruiting Classical which each year sees over 600 Global Majority players audition for the top orchestras in the UK. Another program is Classically Black, which showcases the very best in cutting-edge classical music \u2013 our next symposiums will be taking place in Birmingham (October 10th), and London (October 18th). We have over 40 orchestras signed-up to our ten-point plan on inclusive recruitment in classical music, which supports a unified approach of recruitment of musicians in orchestras in the UK classical music sector.</p><p><b>What impact have you had? \n</b>Our research has had a huge impact. Being Black In The UK Music Industry, Unseen Unheard (which looked at the lived experience of Black disabled creators and professionals), and Your Safety, Your Say \u2013 our research into bullying and harassment in the music industry \u2013 have led to national conversations and tangible change at government level. Our REMEL (Race Equality in Music Event Licensing) research has seen us give recommendations to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mayor of London and Chancellor of Exchequer. We launched an Anti Racist Code of Conduct and will launch EquiTrack, a tech tool which will help the UK Music Industry reach their diversity objectives. And our training programmes are placing young people into real jobs and roles they never imagined possible, like working on major festivals and classical stages.</p><p><b>What is the most rewarding thing about the work that you do?\n</b>It\u2019s seeing someone walk into a space they once thought wasn\u2019t for them and realise they belong. It\u2019s the emails that say, \u201cI was about to give up, but BLiM reminded me why I started.\u201d It\u2019s the young sound engineer working their first big stage. Those are the moments that keep us going.</p><p><b>How can someone benefit?\n</b>If you\u2019re working in music, we\u2019re here to support you through mentoring, training, advocacy and connection. And if you\u2019re an ally, there\u2019s room for you too. We welcome volunteers, donors and organisations that want to do better. Whatever your role, you\u2019ll find that being part of BLiM means being part of a movement that\u2019s bigger than any one of us.</p><p><b>How do organisations like Glastonbury\u2019s help BLiM? \n</b>Support from Glastonbury and others is vital. They help turn inclusion from talk into action. By offering opportunities to our engineers, they\u2019re not just diversifying their crew, they\u2019re setting a new standard for the industry. Their platform also amplifies our voice, helping us reach more people, open more doors and create more impact. It\u2019s a partnership that proves representation works, on stage, off stage and everywhere in between.</p><p><b>Where can people find out more about supporting you or getting involved?\n</b>Visit <a href=\"https://blim.org.uk/\">blim.org.uk</a> to sign up, donate, partner or just learn more. Follow us @BlackLivesInMusic on IG and TikTok and @blklivesinmusic on X to join the conversation.

And as part of our <a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/sustainability/love-the-farm-leave-no-trace/\">Love Worthy Farm, Leave No Trace</a> campaign we\u2019d definitely encourage you to <b>only bring things which you can take home</b> \u2013 that includes everything, even your tent.</p><p><b>Please use luggage tags</b>. Please label all of your bags and belongings stating your name and mobile number, so that we can identify them as yours.</p><p><b>Please be patient.</b> For security reasons, ticket holders may be subject to searches of their vehicles, their bags and their person at this year\u2019s Festival. Please cooperate with any security requests and all searches.</p><p><b>The less you bring, the quicker you\u2019ll get through the gates. </b>As a general rule, we would ask you to only bring as much as you can carry yourself. We do appreciate that you\u2019re going to be staying on the farm for several days, but travelling light really will make things quicker. There will be separate search lanes for those with large luggage and trolleys, and we anticipate that these lanes will be significantly slower.</p><p><b>Please do not wrap your bags.</b> Avoid using the thick plastic wrap you sometimes see at airports. Your bags will need to be accessible for searches and you\u2019ll be bringing unnecessary waste onto the Festival site.</p><p><b>Don\u2019t skimp on the essentials</b>. Please bring a sturdy tent (and take it back home with you). Although you\u2019ll be able buy pretty much anything you need here on site, there are now fewer camping equipment stores than there have been in the past. So please bring a sturdy tent that will last a lifetime of festival camping.</p><p><b>Please be a considerate Festival-goer</b>. If you bring camping chairs / blankets to use at busy stages, please make sure that they are kept away from designated paths; and that there is plenty of room between you and the next set of chairs / blankets, so that people can still easily walk through, being mindful not to leave valuable things on rugs for people to trip over. Please also bear in mind that for some people, having somewhere to sit is not a luxury but essential to their ability to see the show \u2013 not all disabilities are visible. For really popular artists, we might need to ask people who are able to, to pack up their rugs / chairs so that as many people as possible can enjoy the show. We only make these announcements when it\u2019s really important, so please help us if you can.</p><p><b>REUSE, REDUCE, RESPECT.</b> In a stand to make our world more sustainable, we ask you to avoid single-use items and opt for reusable options wherever possible and help us look after the land on which the Festival stands.</p><p><b>What to bring</b></p><ul><li><p>Festival ticket</p></li><li><p>Travel tickets if coming by coach / train</p></li><li><p>Personal ID: Original ID documents (not photocopies) are needed for: Hospitality tickets, Challenge 21, Lead Booker for coach packages, Sunday tickets. \u2013 Photocopy of ID is okay if a child is under 12 but looks older.</p></li><li><p>Driving licence (ideally with up to date address, so it \u2013 and anything with it \u2013 can be posted back to you if lost).</p></li><li><p>Money/cards</p></li><li><p>Mobile phone + battery pack.
