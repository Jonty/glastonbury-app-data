And definitely try to avoid arriving just before or during a popular set.</p><p><b>Explore outer space.</b> Head out of the main stage arenas to discover the eclectic otherness and unexpected wonders \u2013 convivial campfires, fringe tents and bonkers bars \u2013 that truly set Glastonbury apart.</p><p><b>Take a break from the hubbub.</b> The site is truly ENORMOUS. For every area that feels busy, there will be another that\u2019s tranquil and calm. If the crowds ever feel too much, head in the opposite direction and you should soon find some space. For example, try the South East Corner during the day or chill out in the main stage arenas once the acts have stopped playing for the night.</p><p><b>Please be considerate of others. </b>If you\u2019re arranging chairs or picnic blankets to watch acts from, please position them in sensible, considerate places and make sure there are clear gaps where other people can easily walk through and be prepared to move them if requested by a steward.</p><p><b>Know that whatever you do will be wonderful.</b> Immerse yourself and just be in the moment.</p>"

This year, drivers can arrive from 9pm.</p><ul><li><p>Please note that there will be no entertainment or facilities (other than toilets) in the car parks and Festival-goers will be expected to remain in their cars until Festival gates open at 8am on Wednesday morning.</p></li><li><p>If you plan to get here early, please make sure you eat before you arrive and that you bring a reusable bottle of water to help keep you cool and hydrated.</p></li><li><p>The busiest time to arrive by car is between 7am and 2pm on Wednesday. </p></li><li><p>Traffic is likely to be flowing more freely after 5pm on Wednesday. Those choosing to arrive on Wednesday evening or on Thursday / Friday are likely to experience less traffic and there will still be camping space available (stewards at the gates can advise where). </p></li></ul><h1>By Bike</h1><p>As part of the Festival&#39;s continued commitment to reducing audience transport C02 emissions, we encourage people to cycle to the Festival. Glastonbury offers free, secure bike lock-ups and a dedicated campsite \u2013 with showers \u2013 for cyclists and Bike to Glasto operates luggage drop-off facilities from London and various locations in Somerset direct to the Festival site.

We want people to bring a sturdy tent that is going to last a lifetime of camping experiences rather than just one festival or summer.</p><h3><b>Please Take it Home</b></h3><p>Since 2019, 98 percent of all tents and camping equipment have been taken home after each Festival. This tremendous collaborative effort is something we are very grateful for. Please continue to \u201cLove the Farm and Leave No Trace.\u201d Tents abandoned in campsites are difficult to recycle and, regrettably, could end up in landfill. Please take down your tent, pack it up, and use it again \u2013 and again!</p><h3><b>Compost Toilets</b></h3><p>We love compost toilets. They are the most environmentally-friendly way of dealing with toilet waste. Not only are they odour- and water-free but after a year decomposing, they also produce a wonderful compost. We will have over 1000 of these across the site this year so give them a go!</p>"

It is extremely difficult to meet at the gates.</p><p>Be prepared to show your ticket for inspection at car park entrances or when catching buses, BUT do not hand over your ticket to anyone, even if they look like stewards, until you reach the turnstiles where they check your ticket/photo.</p><p>Do not leave the turnstile until you have been wristbanded by a gate steward \u2013 and make sure that your wristband is firmly secured. If you have a problem there are Ticket Enquiry Cabins near Pedestrian Gates.</p><p>Keep your ticket and wristband safe once on site, as you&#39;ll need them if you want to leave/re-enter the site, including going to and from car parks, caravan and campervan fields and offsite campsites (e.g. Worthy View).</p><p>Follow Gate Stewards\u2019 instructions about passouts. There are dedicated lanes for Festival-goers who have already been on site which are separate from those arriving for the first time. Get yourself in the correct lane.</p><h1>Money</h1><p>There are cash machines around the Festival site. All ATMs are open 24 hours a day, and accept all major debit and credit cards. There is a \u00a32.95 charge per transaction. </p><p>Get cash out with a friend for security \u2013 and expect to queue at peak times.</p><h1>Children</h1><p>The same notions of responsible childcare apply at Glastonbury Festival as they would in any busy city environment: </p><ul><li><p>Please be aware that buggies and kinder wagons can be awkward to manoeuvre and difficult for other pedestrians to see in busier areas. Please allow crowds to disperse before attempting to move your children and be mindful of taking young children into densely crowded areas. </p></li><li><p>Some busy adult-orientated late-night areas, particularly our venues in the South East Corner, are not appropriate for younger audiences at night. We strongly advise families with younger children under the age of 13 to leave these areas before 10pm. Even for teenagers under the age of 18, these areas may not be suitable after this time. </p></li></ul><p>Children aged 12 and under have free entry when accompanied by a ticket-holding adult at all times. If your child looks over 12, it would be wise to have some ID to confirm their age.</p><p>Markable wristbands for kids will be available from Green Kids, the Kidzfield and at Info points. Please use them to write on your contact phone number. A simple but effective way of reuniting you with your wandering child!</p><p>If you want somewhere quiet to camp, there are two Family Camping Fields, one to the north-west and one on the north-east side of the site. If you are arriving late-on, you are more likely to find space still available on the west side.</p><p>For lost kids, see under Medical &amp; Welfare.</p><h1>Fire</h1><p>Common sense prevails here, but please note these useful guidelines:</p><p>If you discover a fire in your camping area, immediately raise the alarm by telling your nearest Steward.</p><p>Candles are dangerous and useless in a field; use torches around tents.</p><p>Only buy wax flares from authorised Festival traders \u2013 check their accreditation.</p><p>Light fires well away from tents and don\u2019t dig holes.</p><p>Use the firewood supplied by the Festival \u2013 never from hedges and trees.</p><p>Don\u2019t burn plastic, please \u2013 it stinks.</p><p>Never use petrol or paraffin to start or revive a fire.</p><p>Camping stalls can provide or change camping gas cylinders for you. If you change them yourself, always do it outside your tent. Ensure the gas tap is in the off position, otherwise the gas will ignite when the cylinder is pierced.</p><p>If you cook, do it outside your tent, and don&#39;t take BBQs inside your tent even when they&#39;re cooling down as they can still give off deadly fumes.</p><p>Do NOT bring or use Chinese sky lanterns. They may look pretty, but they are banned from the site.</p><p>Legislation about not smoking inside public places applies to all tented venues on site.</p><h1>Medical and Welfare</h1><p>Festival Medical Services (FMS) have doctors, nurses and other health professionals on site throughout. The principal facility is Big Ground Medical supported by medical units in Park Home and Cabaret and First Aid at Worthy View.</p><p>There are two dispensing/retail pharmacies \u2013 at Big Ground and on the trader run between the Bread &amp; Roses Bar and The Circus Tent.</p><p>Worthy Welfare/SARSAS \u2013 situated at the top of Big Ground, near the Church (it will be well signposted) \u2013 is the main centre for practical welfare support, which is open 24 hours a day throughout the Festival. If your problem is practical rather than medical, try here first. Staffed by expert providers, it offers a range of confidential services including caring for people who are experiencing difficulties after consuming drugs or alcohol, those with crowd anxiety, people separated from friends or families, as well as offering information about specialist services including drugs and counselling. It is also a good place to go if you lose all your kit, for example \u2013 not least because they also handle Lost Property during the Festival. They also look after found children after 7pm (found kids are looked after in the Kidzfield until that time).</p><p>Green Welfare \u2013 run by iTHINC harm reduction team \u2013 is situated just beyond the railway line at the entrance to the Green Fields. Green Welfare is a good place to head for if you\u2019re feeling under the weather or just need somewhere quiet to sit and chat to someone.</p><p>Worthy Rest tents \u2013 situated in Silver Hayes and The Park \u2013 are places where anyone can go if they need some time away from it all.
